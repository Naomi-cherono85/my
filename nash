they say is a choice and i believe that to be true because everyday because everyday since i met u i have chosen to love u before i even new fully before i felt safe to say that i love and cherrish u so much.they say love tests u as if u constantly care. Things start to go wrong and love might not feel so fair. I would love u tomorrow and most importantly today. I know am not perfect bt i still love uwhat if we dont make it, what if we will if love is achoice i breath my love for youlike air
